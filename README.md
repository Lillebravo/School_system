# School_system
exercise that incorporates classes to make an admin system for schools

I want to make the list of students and teachers an ordered list sorted by name and each person in the list should be clickable. 
If clicked upon relevant buttons should appear, IE relegate student/grade student if its a student, or fire teacher if it's a teacher.

this might come in handy:
